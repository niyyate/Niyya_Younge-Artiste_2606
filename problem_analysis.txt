Envision the way the company does business now, i.e. before this system is in place. With respect to this
preexisting situation, list at least five problems with the current state of affairs that would be solved or improved
by the proposed system.

The current system in place doesn't have any user interface, has no transaction tracking, only students are able to use the system, users have to request and account and be manualy created and to modify or remove a book from the kiosk the user had to call the main office.    



For each problem, provide a system improvement objective that would be accomplished and that would be
measurable in some objective way. Refer to our text for discussion of what good examples of system
improvement objectives are.

(quanitative: sales, user satisfaction, faster ect. )
