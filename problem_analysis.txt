Envision the way the company does business now, i.e. before this system is in place. With respect to this
preexisting situation, list at least five problems with the current state of affairs that would be solved or improved
by the proposed system.

  The current system in place doesn't have any user interface, has no transaction tracking, only students are able to use the system, 
  users have to request and account and be manualy created and to modify or remove a book from the kiosk the user had to call the main 
  office.    



For each problem, provide a system improvement objective that would be accomplished and that would be
measurable in some objective way. Refer to our text for discussion of what good examples of system
improvement objectives are.
(quanitative: sales, user satisfaction, faster ect. )

  By creating a user interface the client will be able to have a visusal component. This will elevate user satisfaction and allow for 
  more trasnactions to be processed

  By adding transaction tracking a uesr can see there history with the company which will lead to client satisfaction. This will also 
  allow for coprehensive data about transactions.

  By adding the University account type their will be an influx of sales, and account creations. 

  By making the user creation automatic the system will be more stream line for the admin's. The user creation process will run faster and
  in turn that will mean more time for users to process transactions.

  By giving users access to modify or remove a book from the kiosk with out calling will help the user complete transactions faster and in 
  turn increase sales
