	Students Buy and Sell Text books on our platform. We make a profit from charging a processing fee for each buy and sell.\
\
Give an estimate of their gross annual revenue using logic similar to that used by the Drake Equation that we discussed in class. \
	\
	30 transactions max daily per kiosk \
	5 transactions min daily per kiosk \
	4 months of max use yearly Sept, Dec, Jan, May * 30 days each month \
	8 months of min use * 30 days \
	240 day of min use * 5 transactions daily = 1200 transaction min  \
	120 days of max use * 30 transactions daily = 3600 transactions max \
	1200 transaction min + 3600 transactions max \
						 = 4800 yearly transaction per kiosk \
	4800  yearly transaction per kiosk * 110 kiosk = 528,000 yearly transaction \
	Min textbook price = $75 \
	Max textbook price = $250\
\
	min textbook price $75* 3% =profit off book 2.25 \
	max textbook price $250* 3% =profit off book 7.50\
\
	528,000 yearly transaction* min profit 2.25 = 1,188,000\
	528,000 yearly transaction* max profit 7.50 = 3,960,000\
	\
	Avg Yearly Profit =  \cf2 2,574,000\cf0 \

What are the transactions that drive your company's operations? \
	We have a buy, drop off, sell transaction.\

	Drop Off - User drops off book at the kiosk and uses app to set the price they are comfortable with\
	Sell - Users put their books in to the kiosk add set there price. When the book is bought the sell transaction happens simultaneously. \
\
How many of each type occurs per day? \
	Buy/Sell - 30 max per kiosk * 110 kiosks = 3,300\
	Drop Off - 30 max per kiosk * 110 kiosks = 3,300\
	\
	Buy/Sell - 5 max per kiosk * 110 kiosks = 550\
	Drop Off - 5 max per kiosk * 110 kiosks = 550\
	\
	Avg Buy/Sell Daily = 1,705\
	Avg Drop Off Daily = 1,705\
