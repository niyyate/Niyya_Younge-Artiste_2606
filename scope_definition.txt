Describe why the company needs it and why the company would be better off after it is in place.
	A transaction processing system would be the best because the system would need to be up at all times. The nature of the system 	requires a set of steps to complete the transaction. The users would require high data availability and high data integrity. The
	systems has to be able to support regular changes. The current system is a managment information system.
	
Provide an estimate of how long it will take to design, implement, and install it.
	The code has already been written for the system but it will have to be redesigned. The databases have to be made more secure. 		The systems have to be implemented and installed at all of the kiosk locations. 


	The redesign will be split up in to 3 phases where the last two happen simultaneously.
		Building 
		Database Integration 
		Graphic Design 

	Each system requirement will be given a minimum of 1 week to be modified/completed by the builders.
	
	12 * 2 = 24 weeks 

	Database Integration would start after the first 3 weeks and would last for a .5 weeks per systems requirement
	
	12 * .5 = 6 weeks 
	
	Graphic Design will be given begin in the 12th week of the project. They well be given 2 weeks per user interface panel
	Client interface 
	Supplier interface
	Administrative interface 
	Company Operations interface
	
	8 weeks (2 weeks more that Database Inegration)
	 
	 Design and Implementaion Total Weeks = 24 + 6 + 2 = 32

		
Provide an estimate of how much will the system design, implementation, and installation cost?

	Sytemes Analysis - $24 - $39 hourly 
		2 Senior ((40hr work week * $39 hourly = 1560) * 32 weeks = $49,920)
	Programmer - $24 - $37 hourly 
	Database Admin -  $22 - $38 hourly 
	Graphic Design - $19 - $32 hourly 
	
	
	
	30% of builder cost for fees.

Provide an estimate of how many people will be needed to carry out everything?
	4 different types of skill sets needed
		Sytemes Analyis
		Programmer
