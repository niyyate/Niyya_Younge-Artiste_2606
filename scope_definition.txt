What information system is being proposed to be designed?
	Transaction Processing System
		The system would facilitate and manage the buying, selling, and renting of textbooks. 
		
Describe why the company needs it and why the company would be better off after it is in place.
	A transaction processing system would be the best because the system would need to be up at all times. The nature of the system 	requires a set of steps to complete the transaction. The users would require high data availability and high data integrity. The
	systems has to be able to support regular changes. The current system is a managment information system.
	
Provide an estimate of how long it will take to design, implement, and install it.
	The code has already been written for the system but it will have to be redesigned. The databases have to be made more secure. 		The systems have to be implemented and installed at all of the kiosk locations. 


	The redesign will be split up in to 3 phases where the last two happen simultaneously.
		Building 
		Database Integration 
		Graphic Design 

	Each system requirement will be given about of 2 week to be modified/completed by the builders.
	
	12 * 2 = 24 weeks 

	Database Integration would start after the first 12 weeks and would last for a 2 weeks per systems requirement
	
	12 * 1.5 = 18 weeks 
	
	Graphic Design will be given begin in the 24th week of the project. They well be given 2 weeks per user interface panel
	Client interface 
	Supplier interface
	Administrative interface 
	Company Operations interface
	
	8 weeks 
	
	Design and Implementaion Total Weeks = 32 weeks

	1 month would be given for implementation and installation 
	
	Total Weeks 32 + 4 = 36

		
Provide an estimate of how much will the system design, implementation, and installation cost?

	Sytemes Analysis - $24 - $39 hourly 
		1 Senior (40hr work week * $39 hourly = 1560) * 36 weeks = $56,160
		
	Programmer - $24 - $37 hourly 
		2 Junior (40hr work week * $24 hourly = 960) * 24 weeks = 23,040 * 2 = $46,080
		1 Senior (40hr work week * $37 hourly = 1560) * 24 weeks = $37,440
		
	Database Admin -  $22 - $38 hourly 
		1 Junior (40hr work week * $22 hourly = 880) * 18 weeks = $15,840
		2 Senior (40hr work week * $38 hourly = 1520) * 18 weeks = $27,360 * 2  = $54,720
		
	Graphic Design - $19 - $32 hourly 
		2 Junior (40hr work week * $19 hourly = 760) * 8 weeks = 6,080 * 2 = $12,160
		1 Senior (40hr work week * $32 hourly = 1280) * 8 weeks = $10,240	
	
	
	Total Salary = $232,640
	30% of fees = $69,792
	
	Total Cost - $302,432

Provide an estimate of how many people will be needed to carry out everything?
	4 different types of skill sets neededn 
		Sytemes Analysis
		Programmer 
		Database Admin
		Graphic Design
	3 people per skill set 
		1 person Systems Analysis and One or two senior team members and at least one junior member 	
	12 people total people.
