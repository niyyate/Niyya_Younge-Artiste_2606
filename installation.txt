37. Provided a complete description of how the finished product is meant to be used in terms of its functional requirements.

The Books Swap system is meant to give students and schools to rent sell and rent textbooks respectively.  A student you will have the ability to buy the books they need from other students. They will also have full access to search all books in our system. Students will have the access to monitor their full account history. If a student is selling a book they can also see how many people have viewed there book for a potential purchase and modify the price accordingly. The other type of user would be a school or university; they would have access the same features as students and the ability to rent textbooks too students. Since we have added the new university user type we have also added employee verification steps. Employees can still delete accounts and process refunds; we have given them the ability to verify college issued email addresses, and to set an account user type. We are now able to effectively monitor the total sales of a whole campus. Our new system allows administrators to view the sales per kiosk, as well as per university.  They will also be able to view sales trends such as the most popular book sold. Overall this new system will make Book Swap better by bringing it in to the twenty-first century.
